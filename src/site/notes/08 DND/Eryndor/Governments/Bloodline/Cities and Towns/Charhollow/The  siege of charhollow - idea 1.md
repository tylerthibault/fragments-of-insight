**Opening Quest: The Siege of Charhollow

**Premise:** The adventurers, a group of travelers with diverse backgrounds and motivations, find themselves passing near the peaceful village of Charhollow. However, they soon discover that the village has been overrun by a band of Goblins, who have taken the villagers hostage and seized control of key locations.

**Part 1: The Divided Front**

1. **Arrival and Discovery:** The adventurers arrive at the outskirts of Charhollow and witness signs of the attack: overturned carts, scattered belongings, and a palpable sense of fear in the air. They encounter a terrified villager who informs them of the situation and pleads for their help.
2. **Splitting the Party:** With a large group (6 or more), the party splits into two smaller groups, each guided by a separate DM. This allows for more focused storytelling and combat encounters.
3. **Skirmish at the Outskirts:** Each group encounters a small band of Goblins patrolling the outskirts of the village. These encounters serve as an introduction to the enemy and allow players to test their abilities.
4. **Ambush at the Farm:** The groups continue their advance, encountering a more challenging battle at a nearby farm. The mountain folk have fortified the farmhouse and are holding villagers hostage. The adventurers must use strategy and teamwork to overcome the enemy and free the captives.

**Part 2: Reclaiming the Heart**

1. **Reunited at the Inn:** The two groups converge at the village inn, a central landmark that has been transformed into the mountain folk's headquarters.
2. **The Battle for the Inn:** A larger-scale battle ensues as the adventurers attempt to reclaim the inn. The Goblins have barricaded themselves inside and are prepared for a fight. The adventurers must utilize their combined strength and diverse skills to overcome the enemy and secure a strategic foothold in the village.

**Part 3: The Road to Liberation**

1. **Splitting the Party (Again):** After securing the inn, the adventurers split once more to tackle different objectives and clear paths toward the town hall.
2. **Encounters Along the Way:** Each group faces a series of smaller encounters as they make their way through the village. These encounters could involve rescuing villagers, securing key locations, or disrupting the Goblin's operations.
    - **Encounters:** Ambush in the market square & hostage situation at the blacksmith's forge

**Part 4: The Final Stand**

1. **Gathering at the Town Hall:** The two groups reunite in front of the town hall, the final stronghold of the Goblins.
2. **Preparing for Battle:** The adventurers have a chance to regroup, heal their wounds, and strategize for the final confrontation. They might gather information, fortify their position, or seek assistance from any liberated villagers.
3. **The Battle for Charhollow:** A climactic battle takes place as the adventurers storm the town hall and attempt to liberate the village. The Goblins leader and their elite warriors put up a fierce resistance. The adventurers must use all their skills and resources to defeat the enemy and restore peace to Charhollow.

**Conclusion:**

With the Goblins defeated and the village liberated, the adventurers are hailed as heroes. They might receive rewards, gain allies, and uncover clues about the Goblins motives, potentially leading to further adventures.
