### **Goblin Dialogue: Patrol Conversations**

#### **Casual Goblin Chatter**

1. _"Boss says we gotta guard the streets. Guard the streets from _what_, I ask? Ain’t nobody comin’ to this stinkin’ place."_
2. _"You smell that? Smells like somethin’ burnin’. Wait… is that the stew?!"_
3. _"Why we gotta walk the whole road, eh? My feet hurt! Let’s just sit by the tree and nap."_
4. _"You ever try that weird meat the boss brought back? Tasted like it was already dead!"_
5. _"I swear if Grot eats all the chicken again, I’m gonna shove my spear right up his—"_

#### **Suspicious Goblin Dialogue**

1. _"Did you hear that? Thought I heard somethin'... maybe a squirrel. Or somethin’ bigger..."_
2. _"Torchlight’s weird out here. Makes the shadows look like they’re movin’. You see that?"_
3. _"Keep your eyes peeled! Boss says we can’t let nothin’ through!"_
4. _"If someone _is_ sneakin' around, they’re gonna get a taste of my blade!"_
5. _"Wait! Shhh! You hear that? Thought I heard somethin' in the bushes..."_

#### **Grumpy Goblin Complaints**

1. _"This is dumb. Why can’t we stay in the inn where it’s warm?!"_
2. _"I ain’t slept in two days, and this armor itches! I’m gonna start fightin’ just to take a break!"_
3. _"How come Snagg gets to sit inside while we do all the work, huh?"_
4. _"I’m tellin’ you, if I see one more bug bite me out here, I’m torchin’ this whole tree."_
5. _"Why do I gotta carry the lantern? Your arm ain’t broke!"_

#### **Bragging and Goblin Boasting**

1. _"Remember that time I stabbed that big guy? Took his coin pouch right off his belt, I did!"_
2. _"Boss said I’m the toughest goblin in the whole gang. Bet you’re jealous, huh?"_
3. _"This one time, I took down three—no, _four_—guards all by myself!"_
4. _"Betcha I can hit that tree branch with my dagger. Watch this!"_
5. _"When we’re done here, I’m gonna ask the boss for my own squad. ‘Bout time I got some respect!"_

#### **Distracted Goblin Banter**

1. _"Hey, you see that bug over there? Looks tasty. Think I can catch it?"_
2. _"Wanna play a game? First one to spot somethin’ weird wins!"_
3. _"What do you think’s in that big tree? Bet there’s somethin’ creepy up there."_
4. _"What you think they’re arguin’ about inside the inn? Bet it’s who gets the last drumstick."_
5. _"Is it just me, or does this torchlight make my shadow look _huge_? Look at it!"_

### **Tips for Delivery**

- Use a mix of casual and suspicious dialogue to keep the tension high for the players. Start with lighthearted or distracted banter, then shift to more alert and suspicious lines as the goblins approach closer or if the players make noise.
- Add variety to the goblin voices. Some might be high-pitched and whiny, others gruff and impatient.
- If the players fail a Stealth check, you can have a goblin say something like:
    - _"Wait a minute... I _know_ I heard somethin’ that time!"_
    - _"Hey! Who’s out there? Come out, or we’re comin’ in swingin’!"_

By weaving in these bits of dialogue, you can make the goblin patrols feel alive and engaging, building the tension as the players try to avoid detection!
