# **Gregor the Hunter**

A solitary figure, Gregor is rarely seen in town except when he brings pelts and fresh game to the butcher. He grew up in the wilderness after his family was killed by bandits, teaching himself to survive by hunting and tracking. Though he seems cold and aloof, Gregor is fiercely loyal to those he cares about. Despite his frequent arguments with Farmer Jedrick, he often leaves a rabbit or bird at the farmer's doorstep during lean times. Gregor harbors guilt for the lives heâ€™s taken, both animal and human, during his years of survival and sees his hunting as both a penance and a necessity.
