# **Elder Hettie Bramble**

Elder Hettie has lived in the town longer than anyone can remember. She was once a midwife and healer, tending to the needs of countless families, but now she spends her days knitting on her porch and sharing stories of the "old days." Hettie claims she once met a wandering mage who blessed her with long life, but most assume itâ€™s just another one of her tall tales. Still, her knowledge of herbal remedies and local lore is unmatched. Some say Hettie is the reason the town survived a devastating plague decades ago, though she humbly brushes off such claims.
