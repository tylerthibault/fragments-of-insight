# Part 2 - Rescuing the Villager

## **During the Battle in the Rusty Lantern**

As the battle in the Rusty Lantern winds down, the party notices a locked door in the corner of the inn. A faint banging and muffled cries for help can be heard from within. After defeating the goblin forces:

- **The Locked Door**:
    - The door is reinforced but old and weathered.
    - **Thieves’ Tools (DC 12)** or **Strength Check (DC 15)**: To unlock or break down the door.
    - Alternatively, the goblin boss, Grot, might have had the **Goblin’s Key** on his person.

## **The Villager**

Inside the room is **[[Charhollow - NPC - Gregor\|Charhollow - NPC - Gregor]]**, a middle-aged man and former hunter who has been imprisoned and roughed up by the goblins. He is frightened and weak but coherent enough to give the party vital information.

**Dialogue for Gregor:**

- _"Thank the gods you’re here! Those filthy goblins… they’ve overrun the town!"_
- _"They’ve been talking about some sort of leader. A big, brutish goblin with a nasty temper. But they don’t call the shots—there’s a wizard. Someone powerful. The goblins are scared of him."_
- _"They’re holed up in the town hall. The boss and the wizard are both there. I overheard them talking about some kind of escape route... underground tunnels, maybe? I don’t know where they lead, but they don’t plan on sticking around forever."_

Gregor suggests the group split up to surround the town hall, but leaves the specifics up to the party.

---

### **Planning the Assault on the Town Hall**

## **Villager’s Suggestion: Split the Party**

Gregor suggests splitting into two teams to catch the goblins and the wizard off-guard:

1. **Team A (Front Assault)**: Creates a distraction at the front entrance, drawing attention.
2. **Team B (Flanking Attack)**: Either sneaks in from the **back entrance** or uses a creative method to **scale the building and attack from the top**.

---

## **Ways to Get to the Roof**

If the group opts to attack from above, here are options for how they can reach the roof:

1. **Climbing Vines**:
    
    - The sides of the town hall are partially overgrown with sturdy vines.
    - **Athletics Check (DC 14)**: To climb the vines and gain access to the roof.
2. **Stacked Barrels and Crates**:
    
    - Near the back entrance, there are crates and barrels that could be stacked to create a makeshift climbing point.
    - **Investigation (DC 12)**: To identify this as a potential route.
    - **Strength (DC 10)** or **Dexterity (DC 12)**: To stabilize the stack.

---

### **Inside the Town Hall**

The town hall is a two-story building with a large open area on the ground floor and a smaller second floor used as an office or storage space. The **boss goblin** and the **wizard** are on the **ground floor**, with their minions spread throughout.

---

### **Optional Fights**

## **Group A: Upstairs Coming Downstairs**

As Group A enters from the upstairs and prepares to descend into the chaos of the main hall, they encounter resistance in the form of a **small goblin ambush** or **trapped environment.**

### **Description of the Upstairs**

The upstairs area consists of a long hallway with several small rooms (former offices or storage spaces). Dust and cobwebs cling to the walls, but the goblins have clearly been here—broken furniture, scraps of food, and crude graffiti cover every surface. The hallway leads to a narrow staircase that descends into the main hall.

### **Encounter: Ambush from the Offices**

As Group A moves through the upstairs hallway, **3 goblin minions** and **1 goblin saboteur** leap out of the side rooms to ambush them. The goblins are lying in wait and will fight to block the group from reaching the stairs.

- **Goblin Minions (3)**:
    
    - AC: 13
    - Damage: 5 on a hit.
    - Tactics: The minions swarm the first PC who enters the hallway, using their numbers to overwhelm.
- **Goblin Saboteur**:
    
    - A more cunning goblin who carries traps and dirty tricks.
    - AC: 15
    - HP: 20
    - Abilities:
        - **Bomb Toss**: Throws a small bomb (10 ft radius, 2d6 fire damage, DC 13 Dexterity save for half).
        - **Grease Trap**: Spills grease in a 10 ft square. PCs entering the area must make a **DC 13 Dexterity Saving Throw** or fall prone.
    - Tactics: The saboteur uses hit-and-run tactics, throwing bombs and then retreating into the side rooms for cover.

---

### **Skill Opportunities**

- **Perception (DC 14)**: To notice goblin tracks leading into the side rooms, giving the group a chance to prepare for the ambush.
- **Stealth (DC 12)**: To move quietly past the goblin rooms, potentially bypassing the encounter entirely.
- **Athletics (DC 15)**: To shove a goblin into a pile of unstable furniture, pinning them under debris (goblin must succeed on a Strength Save DC 13 or be restrained).

---

### **Environmental Features**

1. **Broken Furniture**:
    
    - Provides half cover to goblins using the side rooms.
    - PCs can throw or kick the debris to block doorways (Strength DC 12).
2. **Rusted Chandelier**:
    
    - Hanging over the staircase, this chandelier can be cut loose with a successful attack. It falls into the hallway, forcing all creatures in its path to make a **Dexterity Saving Throw (DC 13)** or take **2d6 bludgeoning damage** and fall prone.

---

### **Resolution**

Once Group A defeats or bypasses the goblins, they reach the narrow staircase. From there, they can see the action in the main hall below, with the goblin warlord barking orders and the wizard casting spells.

---

## **Group B: Entering Through the Back Door**

Group B enters through the back of the Town Hall, moving through a series of small rooms and hallways before reaching the main hall. This group encounters a **trapped hallway** or a **shaman preparing reinforcements.**

### **Description of the Back Hallway**

The backdoor opens into a storage area filled with barrels, crates, and stolen goods. A narrow hallway leads deeper into the building, branching into small rooms that were likely used for bookkeeping or storage. The goblins have repurposed these rooms into crude barracks, with makeshift bedding and scraps of stolen food scattered everywhere.

### **Encounter: Goblin Shaman’s Preparations**

As Group B makes their way through the hallway, they come upon a **goblin shaman** and **4 goblin minions**, preparing for battle in the main hall. The shaman is performing a crude ritual to summon more goblins or bolster the ones already present.

- **Goblin Minions (4)**:
    
    - AC: 13
    - Damage: 5 on a hit.
    - Tactics: Two minions guard the hallway, blocking the group’s progress, while the other two rush forward to engage in melee.
- **Goblin Shaman**:
    
    - AC: 14
    - HP: 30
    - Abilities:
        - **Summon Minions (1/Day)**: Summons 3 goblin minions from the surrounding crates and barrels.
        - **Burning Hands**: Casts this spell to hit a cone of PCs, dealing 3d6 fire damage (Dexterity save DC 13 for half).
        - **Healing Chant**: Restores 10 HP to a nearby ally (including minions or the goblin warlord).
    - Tactics: The shaman stays behind the minions, using the narrow hallway to force PCs to approach single-file.

---

### **Skill Opportunities**

- **Investigation (DC 12)**: To spot signs of the ritual (e.g., glowing glyphs on the floor or crude totems).
- **Arcana (DC 14)**: To identify the shaman’s ritual and disrupt it by destroying one of the totems (requires an attack roll or Strength DC 12 to break it).
- **Stealth (DC 13)**: To sneak past the shaman and minions, potentially setting up a pincer attack when Group A engages in the main hall.

---

### **Environmental Features**

1. **Crates and Barrels**:
    
    - Provides half cover. Players can use a Strength check (DC 14) to topple them, creating a 5-foot barrier that slows enemies (or the group) by half their movement.
2. **Ritual Totems**:
    
    - The shaman has placed crude totems in the room to amplify their magic. Destroying the totems weakens the shaman’s **Summon Minions** ability, forcing them to roll a d6 on subsequent turns. On a roll of 1-3, the ability fails.
3. **Explosive Barrels**:
    
    - Some barrels are filled with flammable oil. Hitting them with fire or force damage creates a **10-foot explosion** that deals **3d6 fire damage** (Dexterity save DC 13 for half).

---

### **Resolution**

If Group B disrupts the shaman’s ritual, the goblins in the main hall are left without reinforcements. If they fail to stop the ritual, the shaman summons additional minions, making the final fight even more chaotic.

---

---

### **Final Boss Fight at the Town Hall**

## **Setting the Scene**

The Town Hall is a two-story building with a large, open main floor, a smaller balcony, and a trapdoor leading to the underground tunnels. The **goblin warlord** and the **wizard** are coordinating from the ground floor, surrounded by an army of minions.

The room is crowded with overturned furniture, piles of stolen loot, and glowing runes etched into the walls by the wizard. A brazier burns in the corner, casting long shadows as the goblins rally to defend their leaders.

---

## **Enemies**

1. **Goblin Warlord (Boss)**:
    
    - **Role**: Tanky melee combatant who commands the battlefield.
    - **HP**: ~90 (adjust for difficulty)
    - **Abilities**:
        - **Battle Cry (Recharge 5-6)**: The warlord shouts, giving all allies within 30 feet advantage on their next attack rolls.
        - **Sweeping Strike**: A melee attack that targets two adjacent PCs. Deals 2d8 + 3 slashing damage.
        - **Command Minions**: As a bonus action, the warlord orders up to 4 minions to move and attack on their turn.
2. **The Wizard (Elite Controller)**:
    
    - **Role**: A spellcaster focused on area control and disruption. The wizard is working to escape into the tunnels below.
    - **HP**: ~70 (but escapes at 30 HP or less)
    - **Abilities**:
        - **Fireball (Recharge 6)**: Hits a 20-foot radius for 8d6 fire damage (Dexterity save for half).
        - **Magic Shield**: Grants the wizard +2 AC until the start of their next turn.
        - **Summon Minions**: The wizard can summon **4 goblin minions** from glowing runes (see below) as an action.
        - **Escape Plan**: When the wizard drops below half HP, they activate the trapdoor and begin retreating through the tunnels. Reinforcements might try to cover their escape.
3. **Goblin Minions (10-15 total)**:
    
    - **Role**: Fodder for the players to cut through, creating chaos and pressure.
    - **AC**: 13
    - **Damage**: 5 damage on a hit (melee or ranged).
    - **Tactics**:
        - Minions swarm spellcasters and archers, forcing concentration checks.
        - Minions try to block corridors or surround PCs to restrict movement.
        - Minions act as distractions, allowing the warlord or wizard to escape or reposition.

---

## **Environmental Hazards**

1. **Trapped Runes**:
    
    - The wizard has inscribed glowing runes on the floor and walls.
    - **Trigger**: A creature within 5 feet of a rune triggers it with a failed Dexterity Saving Throw (DC 13).
    - **Effect**: The rune explodes, dealing 2d8 fire damage to all creatures in a 10-foot radius.
2. **Overturned Furniture**:
    
    - Provides **half cover** for creatures using it to block line of sight.
3. **Collapsing Balcony**:
    
    - If the balcony takes 15 points of damage from AoE attacks or melee strikes, it collapses. Creatures on it must make a **DC 14 Dexterity Saving Throw** or take 3d6 bludgeoning damage and fall prone.
4. **The Trapdoor**:
    
    - Located near the center of the room. The wizard uses it to escape at half health, leading to underground tunnels. A **Perception (DC 15)** check reveals its location before the wizard uses it.

---

### **Combat Flow**

1. **First Wave: Chaos**
    
    - The fight begins with **6 goblin minions**, the goblin warlord, and the wizard. The warlord rallies the minions to attack the PCs head-on, while the wizard positions themselves at the back of the room, casting control spells.
    - Players should feel surrounded, with minions blocking paths and attacking en masse.
2. **Second Wave: Reinforcements**
    
    - At initiative count 10 in Round 2, the wizard uses their **Summon Minions** ability to spawn **4 more goblin minions** from the glowing runes. Describe them crawling out of the cracks in the floor, cackling wildly.
3. **Mid-Fight Transition**
    
    - When the warlord drops below half HP, he uses **Command Minions** to direct the remaining goblins to cover his retreat, moving to defend the wizard.
    - The wizard, if below half HP, begins to flee toward the trapdoor. If the players don’t stop them, they escape into the tunnels.
4. **Climactic Finish**
    
    - The fight ends when the warlord is defeated. If the wizard escapes, they leave a lingering threat for the party to pursue in future sessions.

---

### **Tactical Advice for Minions**

- **Swarming PCs**: Minions should focus on overwhelming individual players rather than spreading out attacks. A group of 3-4 minions can target a single character, creating real danger despite their low individual power.
    
- **Use Cover and Positioning**: Minions should take advantage of the overturned furniture and cluttered battlefield to force PCs to move and waste attacks. They can block narrow corridors or shield the wizard.
    
- **Combine Minions with Hazards**: Minions can force PCs into hazardous areas, like the rune traps or the collapsing balcony.
    

---

### **Rewards**

1. **From the Warlord**:
    
    - A **+1 Weapon** appropriate to the party’s level.
    - A **Battle Standard** (minor magical item): When planted in the ground, allies within 10 feet gain +1 to attack rolls for 1 minute (usable once per long rest).
    - A map or note hinting at the wizard's plans.
2. **From the Wizard**:
    
    - A **Scroll of Fireball** (if they are killed or captured).
    - A journal or letter revealing their alliance with a larger threat, such as a rival kingdom, a demon, or another faction.

---

### **Wizard’s Escape and Underground Tunnels**

When the wizard escapes, describe him activating a hidden mechanism (like pulling a lever or stepping on a pressure plate) that opens a trapdoor leading into the tunnels below. The remaining goblins fight to cover his escape.

**The Tunnel Hook**:

- Gregor might mention rumors of **smuggler tunnels** beneath the town, explaining the wizard’s escape route.
- The tunnel system can lead to new areas of the campaign, such as:
    - **A hidden goblin fortress**.
    - **A mysterious dungeon** where the wizard is working on dark experiments.
    - **A larger city** where the wizard has powerful allies.

---

### **Outcome**

- The party defeats the goblin boss and secures the town hall but misses the wizard, creating a hook for the next session.
- The split approach (front and back, or back and roof) gives players the chance to feel tactical and clever.
- The underground tunnels introduce a larger mystery and an ongoing threat, setting up the campaign for future adventures.

This plan gives you flexibility for combat, exploration, and narrative while letting the players feel like heroes who outsmart the enemy!
