# **Group A's Entry: The Back Door**

- **Setup**: Group A approaches the **rear entrance** of the Rusty Lantern. The door creaks on its hinges, revealing a dark and musty storage area filled with barrels, crates, and the faint scent of spilled ale and rotting wood.
- **Skill Checks**:
    - **Perception (DC 12)**: Players notice faint blood smears leading deeper into the hallway, indicating recent violence.
    - **Stealth (DC 14)**: If Group A tries to sneak in, this determines whether nearby enemies hear their approach.

## **Encounters in the Back Hallway**

As the players progress through the back hallway, they’ll face tight spaces that funnel movement, forcing careful decision-making. Here’s a room-by-room breakdown:

---

# **Room 1: Storage Area (Back Entrance)**

- **Description**: The room is cluttered with barrels, crates, and sacks. A small, dim lantern hangs from the ceiling. The area is quiet but unsettling.
- **Encounters**:
    - **Option 1: Swarm of Rats** (2-3 swarms): These creatures emerge from the shadows, hungry and aggressive. They aim to swarm the players, making AoE attacks highly effective.
    - **Option 2: Trapped Supplies**: A trap has been rigged to a stack of barrels. A **Perception or Investigation (DC 15)** check spots a tripwire that will release the barrels, dealing 2d6 bludgeoning damage to anyone in their path.
- **Skill Opportunities**:
    - **Investigation (DC 13)**: To search the crates for useful supplies. Players might find a health potion, ammunition, or other minor items.
    - **Animal Handling (DC 12)**: To distract or calm the rats instead of fighting them.

---

# **Room 2: Narrow Hallway**

- **Description**: The hallway is barely wide enough for two characters to stand side by side. Doors line the hallway, most leading to small, darkened rooms.
- **Encounters**:
    - **Ambush**: 2-3 Bandits or Scouts hiding behind barrels or inside one of the rooms. They leap out once the players are in the middle of the hallway.
    - **Skill Opportunities**:
        - **Perception (DC 12)**: To spot shadowy figures waiting to strike.
        - **Dexterity Saving Throw (DC 14)**: If the enemies throw a small keg of flammable oil into the hallway, players must dodge the resulting explosion or take 3d6 fire damage.

---

# **Room 3: Rear Sleeping Quarters**

- **Description**: A set of small bedrooms used by the staff. Beds are overturned, and bloodstains mark the floor. A muffled sound of movement comes from one of the rooms.
- **Encounters**:
    - **Option 1: Frightened Hostage**: A bartender is hiding under one of the beds. They can provide valuable information:
        - **Insight (DC 12)**: To determine if the NPC is trustworthy.
        - **Persuasion (DC 14)**: To convince them to share what they know. They reveal that a powerful enemy waits in the tavern’s main room.
    - **Option 2: Undead Servants**: A necromancer’s spell has animated the staff’s corpses. 2-3 zombies rise as the players investigate.
- **Skill Opportunities**:
    - **Medicine (DC 12)**: To examine bloodstains and determine the wounds were caused by something sharp and ritualistic.

---

# **Room 4: Kitchen**

- **Description**: This room contains a large hearth and preparation tables. The hearth is still warm, and half-chopped vegetables litter the counters. A dead cook lies sprawled on the floor, a butcher’s knife embedded in their chest.
- **Encounters**:
    - **Animated Objects**: Utensils and kitchen tools animate, attacking the players (2-3 Animated Objects). The butcher’s knife becomes a flying weapon, attacking with slashing damage.
    - **Environmental Hazards**:
        - **Spilled Grease**: A patch of grease on the floor requires a **Dexterity Saving Throw (DC 12)** to avoid falling prone.
        - **Flammable Hearth**: A fire spell or similar effect could cause the room to ignite, forcing players to act quickly.
- **Skill Opportunities**:
    - **Arcana (DC 13)**: To determine that the animated objects are controlled by an external force (possibly the main villain).
    - **Investigation (DC 14)**: To find a trapdoor in the corner leading to the cellar, which could bypass the main tavern room.

---

# **Room 5: Rear Hallway Leading to the Main Tavern**

- **Description**: This narrow hallway leads directly to the main tavern room, where Group B is engaged in battle. The players can hear shouting, the clash of steel, and the crackle of magic through the door ahead.
- **Encounters**:
    - **Mini-Boss Fight**: Before they reach the tavern room, Group A is intercepted by the main villain’s lieutenant—a skilled fighter or spellcaster designed to wear them down before the final battle.
    - Suggested Enemy: A **Veteran** with a small group of 2-3 Bandit lackeys or a **Mage** casting spells to control the battlefield.
- **Skill Opportunities**:
    - **Stealth (DC 15)**: To approach unnoticed and gain a surprise round.
    - **Perception (DC 13)**: To listen for clues about Group B’s fight in the tavern room.
    - **Athletics (DC 14)**: To kick down the door dramatically, entering the tavern with flair.

---

# **Climactic Entry into the Tavern**

Once Group A defeats the lieutenant and breaches the door, they enter the main tavern room and join Group B, who are in the middle of a desperate fight against the main villain and their forces. The timing should feel cinematic, with Group A’s arrival turning the tide of the battle.

This setup ensures Group A faces meaningful challenges while tying their actions into the overall narrative. The tight spaces and environmental hazards in the back hallway will also add tension and force creative solutions from the players.
