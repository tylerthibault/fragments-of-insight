# The Inn

### **Boss Fight #1: Inside the Rusty Lantern**

#### **Setting the Stage: The Rusty Lantern Interior**

The inn’s once-cozy charm is gone. The tables are overturned, the hearth burns out of control, and goblins scurry about, arguing loudly and brandishing their weapons. The large central area of the inn is cluttered with debris, offering both cover and hazards. Flickering torchlight dances across the walls, casting long shadows of goblins preparing for a fight.

**Key Features of the Inn**:

1. **Central Area (Main Hall)**:
    - Tables and chairs are overturned, providing **half cover** for creatures hiding behind them.
    - A large, roaring hearth in the center is beginning to spit embers. At initiative count 20, roll a d6. On a 5-6, embers scatter in a 10-foot radius, forcing creatures in the area to make a **DC 13 Dexterity Saving Throw** or take 1d6 fire damage.
2. **Storage Room (Back Entry)**:
    - Group B enters through the storage area, filled with barrels and crates. This is a staging ground for goblins preparing an ambush. Players can use the barrels as **improvised weapons** or destroy them to block goblins’ escape routes.
3. **Upper Balcony**:
    - A rickety wooden balcony overlooks the main hall. **2 goblin archers** take up position here and rain arrows down on the players. The balcony can collapse if struck with sufficient force (see Environmental Hazards).
4. **Kitchen (Side Area)**:
    - A small side room with cooking supplies. A goblin boss may retreat here to regroup or use it to flank the PCs.

### **Enemy Composition**

Since this is the first of two boss fights, the enemies should be tough but manageable. Focus on a mix of goblins and one central boss with unique abilities.

#### **Enemies**

1. **The Goblin Boss (Leader)**:
    
    - **Name**: Grot the Butcher
    - **HP**: ~80
    - **Abilities**:
        - **Leadership (Recharge 5-6)**: As a bonus action, Grot shouts commands. All allied goblins within 30 feet gain advantage on their next attack roll.
        - **Whirling Cleaver**: Grot swings his massive butcher’s cleaver in a 10-foot radius. Each creature in range must make a **DC 14 Dexterity Saving Throw** or take 2d8 slashing damage.
        - **Retreat Tactics**: If reduced to half HP, Grot throws a smoke bomb (creates **heavily obscured** area in a 10-foot radius for 1 round) and retreats to the kitchen.
2. **Goblin Archers (2)**:
    
    - Positioned on the balcony. They prioritize targeting spellcasters or ranged PCs.
    - **HP**: 22 each.
    - **Tactic**: Use ranged attacks and move to avoid melee combat.
3. **Goblin Grunts (6)**:
    
    - Spread throughout the main hall and back areas. These are your standard goblins, using basic attacks but working together to overwhelm PCs.
    - **HP**: 12 each.
    - **Tactic**: Use the overturned tables and debris as cover to ambush PCs.

### **Dynamic Combat Features**

#### **Starting Conditions**

- **Group A**: Enters through the front door, facing the goblin grunts and Grot the Butcher in the main hall.
- **Group B**: Enters through the back storage area, encountering the goblin shaman and a few grunts.
- Once both groups are inside, they converge in the main hall for the boss fight.

#### **Environmental Hazards**

1. **Collapsing Balcony**:
    
    - The balcony is unstable. If it takes **15 points of damage**, it collapses, forcing creatures on it to make a **DC 14 Dexterity Saving Throw** or take 3d6 bludgeoning damage and fall prone.
2. **Roaring Hearth**:
    
    - The hearth scatters embers at initiative count 20 (see Central Area).
    - Players can shove enemies into the hearth with a **shove attack** (Athletics vs. Athletics/Acrobatics). A creature pushed into the hearth takes **2d6 fire damage**.
3. **Exploding Barrels**:
    
    - Barrels in the storage room contain flammable oil. If struck with fire or force, they explode in a **10-foot radius**, dealing **3d6 fire damage** (DC 13 Dexterity Save for half).

### **Combat Flow**

#### **Round 1-2: Establish Positions**

- **Group A**:
    - Faces the goblin grunts and Grot in the main hall.
    - Likely spends the first round moving into cover and engaging the nearest enemies.
- **Group B**:
    - Deals with the goblin shaman and grunts in the storage area.
    - Needs to push quickly into the main hall to help Group A.

#### **Round 3-4: Convergence**

- Both groups converge in the main hall, turning the fight into a chaotic melee.
- Grot uses **Whirling Cleaver** to control the area and retreats to the kitchen if his HP drops.

#### **Round 5+: Boss Showdown**

- Once the grunts and archers are eliminated, the focus shifts to Grot. His retreat to the kitchen gives him a defensive advantage, forcing the players to deal with environmental hazards like tight spaces or flammable oil.

### **Treasure and Rewards**

#### **Loot from Grot**:

- **Grot’s Cleaver** (Magic Weapon): A large +1 greatsword that deals an extra 1d6 slashing damage on a critical hit.
- **Goblin’s Key**: Opens a locked chest in the storage room, containing:
    - 50 gold pieces.
    - A **Potion of Greater Healing**.
    - A small, enchanted trinket that glows faintly when goblins are near (utility item).

#### **Goblin Shaman’s Treasure**:

- A crude spellbook containing 2-3 first-level spells that a wizard or cleric could learn (or sell).

### **Conclusion of the Fight**

After the battle:

- The party has a moment to regroup and roleplay, sharing what they encountered while entering the inn.
- Clues found in the goblin loot (e.g., maps, letters) can hint at the **second boss fight** and the goblin leader’s ultimate plans.

This encounter should feel cinematic, with dynamic hazards and tactical opportunities for both groups of PCs!

The adventurers emerged victorious from the fray, the last goblin falling with a thud. Panting and bruised, they turned their attention to the bound and gagged villagers. Elder Hettie Bramble, Gregor the Hunter, and Owen Kel, the town scribe, were quickly freed from their restraints.

"Bless you, heroes!" Hettie gasped, her voice shaky. "You saved us from a grim fate."

Gregor, rubbing his sore wrists, nodded in agreement. "Those fiends had us tied up like pigs for slaughter."

Owen Kel, ever the meticulous scribe, straightened his spectacles and cleared his throat. "While we are eternally grateful," he began, his voice regaining its usual firmness, "I'm afraid our ordeal is far from over. The goblins have forced our blacksmith, Silas, to work for them. They're holding him captive at his own forge, forcing him to make weapons for their wicked army."

"We must rescue him!" cried Hettie, her eyes filled with worry.

"Indeed," Owen confirmed, pointing to a detailed map of the village hanging on the wall. "And that's not all. Farmer Giles went missing yesterday. We fear he may have been taken by the goblins as well."

Gregor, his face grim, added, "The Town Hall is now a goblin stronghold. Groglug the Ruthless, their leader, and a warlock named Malkor have taken control. They're no doubt plotting something sinister."

The adventurers, realizing the gravity of the situation, knew they had to act swiftly.

"We'll split into two groups," one of them declared. "Some of us will head to the forge and free the blacksmith, while the others search for the missing farmer. We'll meet back at the Town Hall to confront Groglug and put an end to this."

The villagers nodded, their eyes filled with a mixture of hope and fear. The fate of their village rested in the hands of these brave adventurers.
