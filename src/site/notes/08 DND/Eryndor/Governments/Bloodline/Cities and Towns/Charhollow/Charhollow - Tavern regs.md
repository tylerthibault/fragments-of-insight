# **Mina Windstep**

Mina was once a renowned adventurer, traveling far and wide in search of treasure and glory. She retired in the town after a leg injury left her unable to keep up with her old companions. She spends her days at the Foaming Mug, regaling anyone who’ll listen with tales of her adventures—though she often embellishes them for dramatic effect. Mina flirts shamelessly with Big Finn, enjoying their playful banter. She secretly longs for one last adventure but feels her time has passed. Despite her rough exterior, she keeps a keen eye out for young townsfolk with potential and often mentors them in secret.

# **Big Finn**

A burly fisherman with a heart as big as his frame, Big Finn has been a staple at the Foaming Mug for years. Known for his booming laugh and love of a good story, he’s often the center of attention in the tavern. Finn enjoys a friendly rivalry with Mina, frequently trying to one-up her tales with his own exaggerated fishing stories. Though he pretends to be a carefree bachelor, Finn has a soft spot for Mina, often leaving her small gifts like trinkets from his fishing trips. However, he believes she deserves someone more adventurous and refuses to admit his feelings outright.
