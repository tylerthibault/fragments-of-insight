# Group A
The sun is setting, casting a warm orange glow over the rolling hills that surround Charhollow. The faint hum of crickets begins to fill the air as twilight creeps over the landscape. The road is a narrow dirt path, flanked on either side by tall grass and sparse clusters of trees, their leaves gently rustling in the breeze. The smell of earth and distant smoke lingers, subtle but out of place for the otherwise serene countryside.

Ahead, the silhouette of Charhollow lies in the distance. From this vantage, the town should look peaceful, with plumes of smoke rising lazily from chimneys—but something is wrong. The smoke is darker, heavier, and rises in chaotic columns rather than steady trails. There’s no sound of village life: no hammering of the smith, no laughter or chatter of townsfolk, no barking dogs. Instead, faint and haunting, the distant echoes of goblin laughter drift across the fields, chilling and alien in the tranquil setting.

The road takes the group dangerously close to the town, but they can still avoid it if they choose. As they continue, movement catches their eye: small, quick shadows darting among the trees ahead. The flicker of torchlight breaks the growing darkness, revealing a hastily constructed goblin scout camp just off the main road. Makeshift tents and crude banners are barely visible through the undergrowth, and the distinct clatter of goblin voices and metal weapons echoes faintly. A foul stench—like rotting meat mixed with sweat—wafts toward the group on the breeze.

The path ahead isn’t blocked, but it’s clear the goblins are scouting this area, patrolling near their newly claimed territory. The adventurers may be able to slip past unnoticed, but that would force them even further towards the town—or they may need to deal with this threat before it grows more dangerous.

## Option A - Taking care of the threat

As the adventurers approach the goblin camp, the faint glow of a fire pit comes into view through the trees. The camp sprawls across a small clearing, its crude tents made of patched leather and mismatched cloth arranged haphazardly around the flames. The goblins are busy—some gnawing on charred meat, others sharpening their jagged weapons, and a few sentries loitering at the edges of the camp, lazily scanning the darkness.

The adventurers pause just beyond the treeline, taking in the scene. The goblins are noisy and distracted, the laughter and jeers masking the sounds of the forest. But danger is ever-present; the goblin sentries, though inattentive, still carry bows and spears at the ready. The group knows they have one chance to approach unseen—or risk being discovered before they can act.

---

### **DM Note: Stealth Opportunity**

Give the group the chance to roll **Stealth checks (DC 13)** as they approach the camp. If the party succeeds:

- They can sneak close to the camp, gaining a vantage point or positioning themselves for an ambush.
- Each character can take a **surprise round** before initiative is rolled.

If the party fails:

- A nearby sentry hears or spots them, triggering the alarm and starting combat.

**Optional Twist:** If more than one player rolls below a 10, a sentry might catch a glimpse of movement but not be entirely sure, prompting them to investigate further. This could give the players one final chance to hide or prepare an ambush.

---

If the adventurers fail the Stealth check, a twig snaps underfoot, loud enough to catch the attention of a nearby goblin sentry. The creature's ears perk up, and it growls a sharp command in Goblin. Its beady eyes scan the darkness, and moments later, it spots the group.

"Humies! Humies here!" the sentry shrieks, its voice high and grating. The camp explodes into motion. Goblins leap to their feet, spilling their food and drink as they grab weapons—rusty scimitars, jagged spears, and crude bows. The sentries lurking in the shadows emerge, snarling and baring yellowed teeth as they ready themselves for battle.

---

### **DM Note: Initiative Rolls**

Once the goblins are alerted, roll for initiative. The goblins in the camp react as follows:

- **First Round:** Goblin sentries and raiders rush to engage the party, while archers take cover behind crates or tents and fire at range.
- **Second Round:** Barkcrush, the goblin leader, joins the fray, shouting commands and charging into combat.

---

The first arrow whizzes past the adventurers, burying itself in the trunk of a tree with a dull _thunk._ Another goblin laughs maniacally, notching another arrow as a pair of raiders charge forward, their jagged weapons glinting in the firelight. The goblins swarm toward the group, moving in a chaotic frenzy. Their small stature and erratic movements make them difficult targets, and their high-pitched war cries echo through the clearing, sending chills down the spines of even the bravest adventurers.

If the party succeeds on the Stealth check, however, they gain the upper hand. The adventurers position themselves behind the cover of trees and tall grass, weapons drawn and spells at the ready. With the goblins unaware of their approach, the group springs into action. Arrows fly, steel flashes, and spells burst into the clearing as the adventurers unleash a devastating surprise attack. The goblins are caught off guard, scrambling to defend themselves as chaos erupts in the camp.

---

### **DM Note: Environmental Opportunities**

Whether the party surprises the goblins or is detected, encourage the players to use the environment creatively:

- **Fire Pit:** The fire pit in the center of the camp can be used to ignite oil flasks, push enemies into flames (Dexterity saving throw, DC 12, for 2d6 fire damage), or obscure vision with smoke.
- **Crates and Tents:** The goblins use crates and tents as half cover (+2 AC). Players can destroy these with attacks, set them ablaze, or use them as their own cover.
- **Ambush from Cover:** If the players succeed in their Stealth rolls, they can position themselves behind trees or shrubs, gaining **advantage on attack rolls** against the goblins during the surprise round.

---

The goblin leader, Barkcrush, steps forward in the second round, his cruel grin illuminated by the firelight. "You think you scare us? Goblins own these woods now!" he snarls, gripping his spiked club tightly. He barks orders to his allies, rallying them to press the attack.

The camp becomes a blur of fire, steel, and shouts. Goblins fight with wild ferocity, using their small size and dirty tricks to try and overwhelm the adventurers. Arrows whiz through the air, scimitars clash against steel, and the firelight casts dramatic shadows across the chaotic battlefield.

---

### **DM Note: Dynamic Combat**

- **Morale Check:** If Barkcrush is defeated, have the remaining goblins roll a **Wisdom saving throw (DC 12)** to determine if they flee or fight to the death.
- **Reinforcements:** If the battle lasts more than 5 rounds or the players make excessive noise, a nearby patrol of 2 goblin raiders may arrive as reinforcements.

The adventurers’ mettle is tested as they battle through the chaos. Whether they succeed through strategy, skill, or sheer grit, this fight will determine their path forward—one that leads ever closer to the heart of the goblin-controlled Charhollow.

The clearing falls silent, save for the crackling of the campfire and the occasional groan of a dying goblin. The stench of blood and charred leather fills the air, mingling with the lingering smoke. The adventurers stand amidst the carnage, their breaths heavy and hearts pounding from the intensity of the fight. The goblins are defeated, their crude weapons scattered across the ground and their makeshift camp in disarray.

As the group regains their composure, a faint sound reaches their ears—soft, muffled sobs, coming from one of the larger, tattered tents near the back of the camp. The firelight flickers against its torn flaps, the movement of shadows within hinting at something—or someone—inside.

## Option B - A Sneaky way around

The adventurers crouch low, the tall grass swaying gently around them as they skirt the edge of the goblin camp. The laughter and clanging of crude weapons echo through the night air, but the flickering firelight only extends so far, casting long, jagged shadows that offer the group a chance to move unnoticed. The acrid stench of goblins—sweat, smoke, and rotting meat—clings heavily to the breeze, making the adventurers wrinkle their noses as they creep closer.

---

### **DM Note:** Stealth Rolls

Have each player make a **Stealth check (DC 13)** to move quietly through the grass and avoid detection by the goblins. If the party fails more than one roll, a nearby goblin sentry may notice their movements and begin investigating.

- If they fail: A goblin sentry investigates, and the party must choose to ambush them or attempt to hide again.
- If they succeed: They avoid detection and continue moving.

---

Ahead, the underbrush grows thicker, and the faint glow of the campfire diminishes. The group presses forward, weaving between sparse trees and shrubs, careful to avoid snapping twigs or brushing against the dry foliage.

---

### **DM Note:** Environmental Hazard

The terrain becomes uneven, with roots and stones hidden beneath the underbrush. Each player must make a **Dexterity saving throw (DC 10)** to avoid tripping or making noise.

- If they fail: They snap a branch or stumble, making noise that could alert a sentry (trigger another group **Perception check (DC 12)** to detect the noise).
- If they succeed: They remain silent and undetected.

---

The dirt path narrows as it slopes downward toward Charhollow, the trail flanked by looming shadows of the forest. Here, the sounds of the goblin camp are replaced by an eerie stillness, broken only by the faint rustle of leaves and the occasional distant howl of a wolf. The silence feels unnatural, oppressive, as if the woods themselves are holding their breath.

As they draw nearer to the outskirts of Charhollow, the air grows heavier with the faint, choking smell of smoke. The towering silhouette of the town comes into view, its familiar landmarks now cloaked in darkness and shadow. The adventurers catch glimpses of ruined buildings through the trees—charred rooftops and splintered walls that stand like the bones of some great beast.

---

### **DM Note:** Perception Check

Ask the players to make a **Perception check (DC 14)** to notice details about the goblin patrols and potential hazards in the area.

- On a success: The players spot a goblin patrol moving through the streets ahead, giving them a chance to plan their approach or avoid detection.
- On a failure: They don’t notice the patrol until it’s closer, forcing them to take immediate action or risk being seen.

---

Suddenly, a faint, rhythmic clatter reaches their ears: the sound of goblin patrols moving through the streets. Dim torchlight flickers in the distance, casting grotesque shadows as goblins shuffle and snarl, poking through the ruins with crude weapons. The group realizes they are no longer safe in the cover of the forest—their path has led them directly into the edge of the town, where the goblins' occupation is undeniable.

Piles of broken furniture and household goods lie scattered near the road, looted from the homes of the townsfolk. A toppled wagon blocks part of the path, its wheel shattered and its contents spilled in disarray. Nearby, the faint sound of muffled sobbing emerges from one of the ruined homes—whether it’s a survivor or another goblin trap remains to be seen.

---

### **DM Note:** Investigation and Insight

If the players investigate the wagon or the sound of sobbing:

- **Investigation check (DC 12):** Reveals claw marks and goblin-sized footprints near the wagon, along with signs of a scuffle.
- **Insight check (DC 13):** Helps determine whether the sobbing is genuine or could be a trap.

---

With no route back and the forest now behind them, the group is forced to move deeper into Charhollow’s darkened streets. Each step is a gamble, each corner a potential ambush. The adventurers grip their weapons tightly, knowing they have no choice but to venture further into the heart of the village and confront whatever horrors lie ahead.

---

### **DM Note:** Building Tension

- At this point, the players should feel the weight of their decision. Add goblin patrols (small groups of 2-3 goblins) moving through the streets, giving the party more opportunities to sneak past or engage in quick skirmishes.
- Encourage the use of skills like **Stealth**, **Perception**, or **Survival** to navigate the ruined town and avoid detection.
- If the players hesitate too long, have a patrol close in on their location, forcing them to act.
