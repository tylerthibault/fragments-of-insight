# Group B 
The sun is setting, casting a warm orange glow over the rolling hills that surround Charhollow. The faint hum of crickets begins to fill the air as twilight creeps over the landscape. The road is a narrow dirt path, flanked on either side by tall grass and sparse clusters of trees, their leaves gently rustling in the breeze. The smell of earth and distant smoke lingers, subtle but out of place for the otherwise serene countryside.

Ahead, the silhouette of Charhollow lies in the distance. From this vantage, the town should look peaceful, with plumes of smoke rising lazily from chimneys—but something is wrong. The smoke is darker, heavier, and rises in chaotic columns rather than steady trails. There’s no sound of village life: no hammering of the smith, no laughter or chatter of townsfolk, no barking dogs. Instead, faint and haunting, the distant echoes of goblin laughter drift across the fields, chilling and alien in the tranquil setting.

As you approached the town , a raucous clamor cuts through the oppressive quiet. It seemed to originate from the "Foaming Mug" tavern, its crooked sign now visible . Drawing closer, you could make out a group of goblins, their crude weapons strewn about the ground, hoisting tankards and bellowing drunkenly in their guttural tongue. One particularly boisterous goblin, adorned with a crudely fashioned crown of bone, seemed to be leading the revelry, clambering atop a table and sloshing ale over its companions.

The sight of these foul creatures occupying the tavern, a place that should have been bustling with miners and townsfolk, sent a chill down your spines. As you look around you notice the horror that came upon Charhollow. Splintered doors hung from their frames, windows were shattered, and overturned carts lay scattered across the cobblestone streets. But it was the blood that truly chilled you to the bone. Dark, crimson stains marred the cobblestones, and lifeless bodies of townsfolk, bearing wounds of brutal violence, lay sprawled in the street. The air was thick with the stench of death and decay.
## Option A: Engage in the Tavern

The adventurers can enter the tavern, blending in with the other patrons. This gives them a chance to observe the goblins and perhaps learn more about their intentions. However, it also increases the risk of a confrontation.

The goblins, sensing the adventurers' presence, might become hostile. They could start a brawl, or they could ambush the adventurers when they least expect it. A successful Perception check might allow the adventurers to anticipate their attack.

### **DM Note: Stealth Opportunity**

Give the group the chance to roll **Stealth checks (DC 13)** as they approach the camp. If the party succeeds:

- They can sneak close to the camp, gaining a vantage point or positioning themselves for an ambush.
- Each character can take a **surprise round** before initiative is rolled.

If the party fails:

- A nearby sentry hears or spots them, triggering the alarm and starting combat.

**Optional Twist:** If more than one player rolls below a 10, a sentry might catch a glimpse of movement but not be entirely sure, prompting them to investigate further. This could give the players one final chance to hide or prepare an ambush.

---

If the adventurers fail the Stealth check, one of the adventurers trips on a rock and crashes to the ground with a loud clatter. 

One goblin, perched precariously atop a rain barrel, squinted through the swirling mist, its bloodshot eyes widening as they fell upon your group. It scrambled down, nearly tumbling headfirst into the mud, before scrambling towards the tavern door.

He shouts into the tavern "Yarp! Snaggletooth! Skull-crackas! More come for bashin'! We show 'em how we worship Gruumsh! Make 'em bleed!"

The raucous laughter within the tavern abruptly ceased. A chorus of grunts and snarls erupted as several hulking goblins, their faces smeared with grime and blood, emerged from the doorway, brandishing crude axes and rusty swords. Snaggletooth, the apparent leader with his bone crown askew, pushed his way to the front, his eyes narrowed into malevolent slits.

"Where?" he growled, his voice thick with ale and menace. "Where are dese warm bloods?

The lookout goblin points his finger in your direction. "Dere! By da gates!""

Snaggletooth let out a guttural roar, spittle flying from his jagged teeth. "Gruumsh hear our prayer and demand more blood. Get 'em, lads!"

The goblins, a mob of snarling, bloodthirsty creatures, surged forward, weapons raised.

A fight is inevitable. Prepare yourselves!

---

### **DM Note: Initiative Rolls**

Once the goblins are alerted, roll for initiative. The goblins in the tavern react as follows:

- **First Round:** Snaggletooth, the goblin leader, joins the fray, shouting commands and charging into combat.
- **Second Round:** Goblin sentries and raiders rush to engage the party, while archers take cover behind barrels and fire at range.

---

Snaggletooth, fueled by cheap ale and bloodlust, roars and charges with a wild swing of his rusty axe. His four goblin cronies, a pack of snarling, ragged figures, surge forward with him, brandishing crude weapons.

Snaggletooth and his cronies are closing in, their bloodshot eyes fixed on the adventurers. The battle is joined!

If the party succeeds on the Stealth check, however, they gain the upper hand. The adventurers position themselves behind the cover of trees and tall grass, weapons drawn and spells at the ready. With the goblins unaware of their approach, the group springs into action. Arrows fly, steel flashes, and spells burst into the clearing as the adventurers unleash a devastating surprise attack. The goblins are caught off guard, scrambling to defend themselves as chaos erupts at the tavern.

---

### **DM Note: Environmental Opportunities**

Whether the party surprises the goblins or is detected, encourage the players to use the environment creatively:

- **Rain Barrells**: Water hazard - If a rain barrel is broken, the water spilling out could create a slippery surface, making it difficult terrain for both the goblins and the adventurers. This could be especially hazardous if combined with a spell like _Grease_.
- **Torches**: Fire Hazard - An adventurer could attempt to knock a torch down, potentially setting fire to the tavern or nearby objects. This could create a distraction or force the goblins to reposition.
- **Ambush from Cover:** If the players succeed in their Stealth rolls, they can position themselves behind trees or shrubs, gaining **advantage on attack rolls** against the goblins during the surprise round.

---

Two more goblins stumble out of the tavern. These two clutch rickety shortbows, fumbling with arrows that seem almost as long as they are. They scramble for cover, ducking clumsily behind the overflowing rain barrels that line the front of the tavern.

With a slurred battle cry of "For Gruumsh!", the archers loose their arrows. One arrow sails wildly over the adventurers' heads, narrowly missing a signpost. The other, fired with even less accuracy, thunks harmlessly into the side of the "Foaming Mug" itself, leaving a splintered scar in the weathered wood. The drunken archers, unfazed by their terrible marksmanship, let out whoops and hollers as if they had struck true.

The street becomes a battlefield. Goblins fight with wild ferocity, using their small size and dirty tricks to try and overwhelm the adventurers. Arrows whiz through the air, scimitars clash against steel, and the stench of death is overwhelmed by adrenaline filled combat.

---

### **DM Note: Dynamic Combat**

- **Morale Check:** If Snaggletooth is defeated, have the remaining goblins roll a **Wisdom saving throw (DC 12)** to determine if they flee or fight to the death.
- **Reinforcements:** If the battle lasts more than 5 rounds or the players make excessive noise, a nearby patrol of 2 goblin raiders may arrive as reinforcements.

The adventurers’ mettle is tested as they battle through the chaos. Whether they succeed through strategy, skill, or sheer grit, this fight will determine their path forward—one that leads ever closer to the heart of the goblin-controlled Charhollow.

**After the battle** 
Redirect the group to the Rusty Lantern
 In the tavern use a note
 If they go north use Orlan the Miller - who was hiding in the woods and saw the battle.

## Option B: Sneak Past

The adventurers can attempt to sneak past the tavern through the narrow alley to its side. This requires a successful Stealth check, modified by any relevant factors such as the wind, noise, or the alertness of the goblins. If they succeed, they can continue on their way undetected.

However, if they fail, they'll alert the goblins. The goblins will likely react with hostility, drawing their weapons and preparing for a fight.


---

## DM Note: Stealth Rolls
Have each player make a **Stealth check (DC 15)** to move quietly through the alleyway and avoid detection by the goblins. If the party fails more than one roll, a nearby goblin sentry may notice their movements and begin investigating.

- If they fail: A goblin sentry investigates, and the party must choose to ambush them or attempt to hide again.
- If they succeed: They avoid detection and continue moving.

---

Dark alleyways loom before them, a maw of darkness swallowing the light from the Foaming Mug. The raucous laughter from within becomes a muffled echo, replaced by the pounding of their own hearts. Each step forward is a venture into the unknown, their senses straining for any hint of danger lurking in the shadows.

---
## DM Notes: Environmental Hazard
The adventurers pressed onward, their boots sinking into the mud and muck that lined the alley floor. The air hung heavy with the stench of decay and damp earth, a stark contrast to the raucous laughter and ale-soaked revelry that spilled from the tavern behind them. Broken barrels and discarded crates lined the narrow passage, forming an obstacle course of forgotten refuse. A chill wind whistled through the gaps in the ramshackle buildings, carrying with it the faint echo of distant screams. Charhollow, once a quaint village, now exuded an aura of despair, its very stones whispering tales of suffering and loss.

**Dexterity saving throw** Rickety stacks of crates and barrels line the alley walls. A careless bump could send them tumbling down. 

- If they fail: If the adventurers fail a Dexterity saving throw, they'll be caught in the collapse, 1 adventurer takes 1d6 bludgeoning damage and potentially alerting roaming goblin patrols.**Perception check (DC 12)** to detect the noise).
- If they succeed: They remain silent and undetected.

---

The grim atmosphere did little to dampen the adventurers' resolve. They pressed on, driven by a shared sense of purpose, though the hope they clung to was a flickering ember in the encroaching darkness. Each cobblestone underfoot, slick with grime and who knows what else, seemed to whisper of the violence that had swept through Charhollow. Reaching the Rusty Lantern was their immediate goal. 
They knew the fight was far from over. If the goblins had truly overrun the town, the inn was unlikely to be an oasis of peace. More likely, it was another battleground waiting to erupt. Every shadow that stretched across the alley walls seemed to conceal a potential ambush, every creak and groan of the dilapidated buildings a prelude to further violence. With weapons at the ready and senses honed, they advanced, watching out for goblin patrols and taking notice of their surroundings for anything that might give them advantage.

---

## DM Notes: Perception Check
Ask the players to make a **Perception check (DC 14)** to notice details about the goblin patrols, potential hazards in the area, and two POI's "Timmy and Ellie's House" and "Gregor the Hunters House".

- On a success: The players spot a goblin patrol moving through the streets ahead, giving them a chance to plan their approach or avoid detection.
- On a failure: They don’t notice the patrol until it’s closer, forcing them to take immediate action or risk being seen.

If the players investigate items, homes, or surveil the streets

- **Investigation check (DC 12):** Players can find knives, food, clothing - none valuable, notice goblin patrols, safe passages to the Inn.

## DM Notes: Optional Sites
**Ellie and Timmy's House** - This home appears to be empty 
- Adventurers can roll a perception check - needs to be greater than 13
	If successful they hear rustling coming from the bedroom.  Upon checking under the bed they find  Timmy. 
		underneath, curled up, lay a young boy, his eyes wide with fear. He couldn't have been older than seven, his face pale and streaked with dirt.

		"Please don't hurt me!" he whimpered, shrinking back into the shadows.

		The boy, his voice barely a whisper, replied, "Timmy... My name is Timmy."
			Timmy's eyes welled up with tears. "They... they went to get help. The goblins... they took my sister." He pointed towards the Rusty Lantern. "They took her there."

- If they fail - they hear nothing and can search the house for other items but find nothing but some meager food.

**Gregor the Hunter** - This house is empty - it has been ransacked by goblins
	- The adventures can roll a perception check and find items.
	-  greater than 18 - find a shield
	-  greater than 15 - find a rusty short sword
	-  greater than 11 - find a knife

---

### **DM Note:** Building Tension

- At this point, the players should feel the weight of their decision. Add goblin patrols (small groups of 2-3 goblins) moving through the streets, giving the party more opportunities to sneak past or engage in quick skirmishes.
- Encourage the use of skills like **Stealth**, **Perception**, or **Survival** to navigate the ruined town and avoid detection.
- If the players hesitate too long, have a patrol close in on their location, forcing them to act.
