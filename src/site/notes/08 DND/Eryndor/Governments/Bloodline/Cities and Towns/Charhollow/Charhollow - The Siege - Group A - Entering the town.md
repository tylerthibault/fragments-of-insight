# The Start
The sun is setting, casting a warm orange glow over the rolling hills that surround Charhollow. The faint hum of crickets begins to fill the air as twilight creeps over the landscape. The road is a narrow dirt path, flanked on either side by tall grass and sparse clusters of trees, their leaves gently rustling in the breeze. The smell of earth and distant smoke lingers, subtle but out of place for the otherwise serene countryside.

Ahead, the silhouette of Charhollow lies in the distance. From this vantage, the town should look peaceful, with plumes of smoke rising lazily from chimneys—but something is wrong. The smoke is darker, heavier, and rises in chaotic columns rather than steady trails. There’s no sound of village life: no hammering of the smith, no laughter or chatter of townsfolk, no barking dogs. Instead, faint and haunting, the distant echoes of goblin laughter drift across the fields, chilling and alien in the tranquil setting.

The road takes the group dangerously close to the town, but they can still avoid it if they choose. As they continue, movement catches their eye: small, quick shadows darting among the trees ahead. The flicker of torchlight breaks the growing darkness, revealing a hastily constructed goblin scout camp just off the main road. Makeshift tents and crude banners are barely visible through the undergrowth, and the distinct clatter of goblin voices and metal weapons echoes faintly. A foul stench—like rotting meat mixed with sweat—wafts toward the group on the breeze.

The path ahead isn’t blocked, but it’s clear the goblins are scouting this area, patrolling near their newly claimed territory. The adventurers may be able to slip past unnoticed, but that would force them even further towards the town—or they may need to deal with this threat before it grows more dangerous.

## Option A - Taking care of the threat

As the adventurers approach the goblin camp, the faint glow of a fire pit comes into view through the trees. The camp sprawls across a small clearing, its crude tents made of patched leather and mismatched cloth arranged haphazardly around the flames. The goblins are busy—some gnawing on charred meat, others sharpening their jagged weapons, and a few sentries loitering at the edges of the camp, lazily scanning the darkness.

The adventurers pause just beyond the treeline, taking in the scene. The goblins are noisy and distracted, the laughter and jeers masking the sounds of the forest. But danger is ever-present; the goblin sentries, though inattentive, still carry bows and spears at the ready. The group knows they have one chance to approach unseen—or risk being discovered before they can act.

---

### **DM Note: Stealth Opportunity**

Give the group the chance to roll **Stealth checks (DC 13)** as they approach the camp. If the party succeeds:

- They can sneak close to the camp, gaining a vantage point or positioning themselves for an ambush.
- Each character can take a **surprise round** before initiative is rolled.

If the party fails:

- A nearby sentry hears or spots them, triggering the alarm and starting combat.

**Optional Twist:** If more than one player rolls below a 10, a sentry might catch a glimpse of movement but not be entirely sure, prompting them to investigate further. This could give the players one final chance to hide or prepare an ambush.

---

If the adventurers fail the Stealth check, a twig snaps underfoot, loud enough to catch the attention of a nearby goblin sentry. The creature's ears perk up, and it growls a sharp command in Goblin. Its beady eyes scan the darkness, and moments later, it spots the group.

"Humies! Humies here!" the sentry shrieks, its voice high and grating. The camp explodes into motion. Goblins leap to their feet, spilling their food and drink as they grab weapons—rusty scimitars, jagged spears, and crude bows. The sentries lurking in the shadows emerge, snarling and baring yellowed teeth as they ready themselves for battle.

---

### **DM Note: Initiative Rolls**

Once the goblins are alerted, roll for initiative. The goblins in the camp react as follows:

- **First Round:** Goblin sentries and raiders rush to engage the party, while archers take cover behind crates or tents and fire at range.
- **Second Round:** Barkcrush, the goblin leader, joins the fray, shouting commands and charging into combat.

---

The first arrow whizzes past the adventurers, burying itself in the trunk of a tree with a dull _thunk._ Another goblin laughs maniacally, notching another arrow as a pair of raiders charge forward, their jagged weapons glinting in the firelight. The goblins swarm toward the group, moving in a chaotic frenzy. Their small stature and erratic movements make them difficult targets, and their high-pitched war cries echo through the clearing, sending chills down the spines of even the bravest adventurers.

If the party succeeds on the Stealth check, however, they gain the upper hand. The adventurers position themselves behind the cover of trees and tall grass, weapons drawn and spells at the ready. With the goblins unaware of their approach, the group springs into action. Arrows fly, steel flashes, and spells burst into the clearing as the adventurers unleash a devastating surprise attack. The goblins are caught off guard, scrambling to defend themselves as chaos erupts in the camp.

---

### **DM Note: Environmental Opportunities**

Whether the party surprises the goblins or is detected, encourage the players to use the environment creatively:

- **Fire Pit:** The fire pit in the center of the camp can be used to ignite oil flasks, push enemies into flames (Dexterity saving throw, DC 12, for 2d6 fire damage), or obscure vision with smoke.
- **Crates and Tents:** The goblins use crates and tents as half cover (+2 AC). Players can destroy these with attacks, set them ablaze, or use them as their own cover.
- **Ambush from Cover:** If the players succeed in their Stealth rolls, they can position themselves behind trees or shrubs, gaining **advantage on attack rolls** against the goblins during the surprise round.

---

The goblin leader, Barkcrush, steps forward in the second round, his cruel grin illuminated by the firelight. "You think you scare us? Goblins own these woods now!" he snarls, gripping his spiked club tightly. He barks orders to his allies, rallying them to press the attack.

The camp becomes a blur of fire, steel, and shouts. Goblins fight with wild ferocity, using their small size and dirty tricks to try and overwhelm the adventurers. Arrows whiz through the air, scimitars clash against steel, and the firelight casts dramatic shadows across the chaotic battlefield.

---

### **DM Note: Dynamic Combat**

- **Morale Check:** If Barkcrush is defeated, have the remaining goblins roll a **Wisdom saving throw (DC 12)** to determine if they flee or fight to the death.
- **Reinforcements:** If the battle lasts more than 5 rounds or the players make excessive noise, a nearby patrol of 2 goblin raiders may arrive as reinforcements.

The adventurers’ mettle is tested as they battle through the chaos. Whether they succeed through strategy, skill, or sheer grit, this fight will determine their path forward—one that leads ever closer to the heart of the goblin-controlled Charhollow.

The clearing falls silent, save for the crackling of the campfire and the occasional groan of a dying goblin. The stench of blood and charred leather fills the air, mingling with the lingering smoke. The adventurers stand amidst the carnage, their breaths heavy and hearts pounding from the intensity of the fight. The goblins are defeated, their crude weapons scattered across the ground and their makeshift camp in disarray.

As the group regains their composure, a faint sound reaches their ears—soft, muffled sobs, coming from one of the larger, tattered tents near the back of the camp. The firelight flickers against its torn flaps, the movement of shadows within hinting at something—or someone—inside.

## Option B - A Sneaky way around

The adventurers crouch low, the tall grass swaying gently around them as they skirt the edge of the goblin camp. The laughter and clanging of crude weapons echo through the night air, but the flickering firelight only extends so far, casting long, jagged shadows that offer the group a chance to move unnoticed. The acrid stench of goblins—sweat, smoke, and rotting meat—clings heavily to the breeze, making the adventurers wrinkle their noses as they creep closer.

---

### **DM Note:** Stealth Rolls

Have each player make a **Stealth check (DC 13)** to move quietly through the grass and avoid detection by the goblins. If the party fails more than one roll, a nearby goblin sentry may notice their movements and begin investigating.

- If they fail: A goblin sentry investigates, and the party must choose to ambush them or attempt to hide again.
- If they succeed: They avoid detection and continue moving.

---

Ahead, the underbrush grows thicker, and the faint glow of the campfire diminishes. The group presses forward, weaving between sparse trees and shrubs, careful to avoid snapping twigs or brushing against the dry foliage.

---

### **DM Note:** Environmental Hazard
The adventurers tread carefully through the dense undergrowth, their movements a symphony of quiet grace. Each step is deliberate, each hand carefully brushing aside branches and leaves. The forest floor is a tapestry of fallen twigs and loose stones, demanding their utmost attention. To proceed safely and silently, each adventurer must make a Dexterity (Stealth) check.

- If they fail: There is a potential to alert roaming goblin patrols. **Perception check (DC 12)** to detect the noise).
- If they succeed: They remain silent and undetected.

---

The dirt path narrows as it slopes downward toward Charhollow, the trail flanked by looming shadows of the forest. Here, the sounds of the goblin camp are replaced by an eerie stillness, broken only by the faint rustle of leaves and the occasional distant howl of a wolf. The silence feels unnatural, oppressive, as if the woods themselves are holding their breath.

As they draw nearer to the outskirts of Charhollow, the air grows heavier with the faint, choking smell of smoke. The towering silhouette of the town comes into view, its familiar landmarks now cloaked in darkness and shadow. The adventurers catch glimpses of ruined buildings through the trees—charred rooftops and splintered walls that stand like the bones of some great beast.

---

### **DM Note:** Perception Check

Ask the players to make a **Perception check (DC 14)** to notice details about the goblin patrols and potential hazards in the area.

- On a success: The players spot a goblin patrol moving through the streets ahead, giving them a chance to plan their approach or avoid detection.
- On a failure: They don’t notice the patrol until it’s closer, forcing them to take immediate action or risk being seen.

---

Suddenly, a faint, rhythmic clatter reaches their ears: the sound of goblin patrols moving through the streets. Dim torchlight flickers in the distance, casting grotesque shadows as goblins shuffle and snarl, poking through the ruins with crude weapons. The group realizes they are no longer safe in the cover of the forest—their path has led them directly into the edge of the town, where the goblins' occupation is undeniable.

Piles of broken furniture and household goods lie scattered near the road, looted from the homes of the townsfolk. A toppled wagon blocks part of the path, its wheel shattered and its contents spilled in disarray. Nearby, the faint sound of muffled sobbing emerges from one of the ruined homes—whether it’s a survivor or another goblin trap remains to be seen.

---

### **DM Note:** Investigation and Insight

If the players investigate the wagon or the sound of sobbing:

- **Investigation check (DC 12):** Reveals claw marks and goblin-sized footprints near the wagon, along with signs of a scuffle.
- **Insight check (DC 13):** Helps determine whether the sobbing is genuine or could be a trap.

---

With no route back and the forest now behind them, the group is forced to move deeper into Charhollow’s darkened streets. Each step is a gamble, each corner a potential ambush. The adventurers grip their weapons tightly, knowing they have no choice but to venture further into the heart of the village and confront whatever horrors lie ahead.

---

### **DM Note:** Building Tension

- At this point, the players should feel the weight of their decision. Add goblin patrols (small groups of 2-3 goblins) moving through the streets, giving the party more opportunities to sneak past or engage in quick skirmishes.
- Encourage the use of skills like **Stealth**, **Perception**, or **Survival** to navigate the ruined town and avoid detection.
- If the players hesitate too long, have a patrol close in on their location, forcing them to act.

# The South Bridge: Scene Description

**As the group approaches the bridge...**

The cobblestone path winds through dense underbrush before opening up to reveal a rickety wooden bridge stretching across a sluggish, murky river. The air is heavy with the scent of damp moss, and the faint croaking of frogs echoes through the eerie silence. The bridge itself looks ancient—its planks are warped and slick with algae, creaking ominously in the breeze. Deep claw marks and muddy goblin footprints suggest frequent use.

Through the mist on the far side, faint torchlight flickers, and guttural goblin voices can be heard laughing and barking orders. You sense movement along the bank on either side of the bridge, though the underbrush obscures any clear view.

---

### **Skill Challenge: Crossing the South Bridge**

**Goal**: The party must cross the bridge undetected while avoiding goblin patrols, unstable planks, and environmental hazards. A total of **6 successes before 3 failures** is required to succeed.

If they succeed, the group crosses the bridge stealthily and avoids detection, setting themselves up for a surprise attack later. If they fail, the goblins are alerted, and reinforcements arrive to ambush the group.

---

    - **Athletics (DC 13)**: Steady yourself or help an ally as the bridge sways and creaks under your weight.
    - **Failure**: A loud creak draws attention from goblins on the far bank, increasing the DC of the next Stealth roll.

---

3. **Avoiding Goblin Patrols** (Primary: Stealth or Deception)
    - **Stealth (DC 14)**: Move quietly across the bridge and into the shadows to avoid being seen.
    - **Deception (DC 15)**: Mimic goblin sounds or use a clever trick to distract the patrol.
    - **Failure**: The goblins become suspicious, increasing the chance of reinforcements (goblins arrive after 3 failures).

---

4. **Navigating a Weak Plank** (Primary: Acrobatics or Thieves’ Tools)
    - **Acrobatics (DC 13)**: Leap gracefully over the weakest part of the bridge without causing damage.
    - **Thieves’ Tools (DC 15)**: Rig the plank to stay in place temporarily for others to cross.
    - **Failure**: The plank breaks with a loud crack, forcing the group to make a quick Strength (Athletics DC 14) check to hold on and climb up.

---

5. **Reaching the Far Side** (Primary: Insight or Stealth)
    - **Insight (DC 12)**: Anticipate the goblins' movement patterns and choose the right moment to dash across.
    - **Stealth (DC 14)**: Slip past the final patrol unnoticed and reach cover on the far side.
    - **Failure**: A goblin sentry spots the group and sounds the alarm, calling for reinforcements.

---

#### **Complications for Failures**

Each failure during the skill challenge introduces an additional hazard:

1. **First Failure**: Goblins become suspicious. Increase the DC for Stealth checks by +2 for the rest of the challenge.
2. **Second Failure**: The bridge begins to collapse in places. All characters must make a Dexterity Saving Throw (DC 13) or fall prone.
3. **Third Failure**: The goblins sound the alarm. Reinforcements (2 goblins and 1 goblin boss) arrive on the far side of the bridge, forcing combat.

---

#### **Creative Player Actions**

Encourage players to think creatively and propose solutions! Here are examples:

- **Nature (DC 12)**: A druid might identify ways to calm the natural environment (e.g., frogs or birds) to mask their movement.
- **Performance (DC 13)**: A bard might create goblin-like sounds to distract the patrol.
- **Arcana (DC 14)**: A wizard might subtly use a spell like _Prestidigitation_ to create harmless sensory effects, distracting the goblins.

---

### **Success**

If the party succeeds, they cross the bridge without alerting the goblins. They gain an opportunity to ambush or outmaneuver the goblins further in the village.

---

### **Failure**

If the group accrues 3 failures:

- Goblin reinforcements (3 goblins and a goblin boss) arrive to ambush them on the far side of the bridge.
- The bridge is partially destroyed, forcing any characters still on it to make a Strength (Athletics DC 15) check to climb out of the river.

---

This structure combines tension, teamwork, and dynamic elements, while keeping the goblins central to the narrative. The skill challenge also ensures that every player can contribute with their unique abilities and creativity!


# Big Fin's House
### **Optional Encounter: Big Fin’s House**

**Context**: Big Fin’s house is a small, ramshackle home near the river on the south side of the village. Once belonging to a well-known fisherman named Big Fin, the goblins have overtaken it and turned it into a makeshift barracks or storage for their stolen loot. The players can choose to investigate the house while crossing the bridge or bypass it entirely.

---

### **Description of Big Fin’s House**

**From the outside:** The house leans precariously to one side, as if the years of riverbank erosion have begun pulling it into the earth. Its once-white walls are stained with mildew, and broken fishing nets hang limply from rusted hooks along the porch. Goblin laughter and the clatter of metal drift through the open windows, along with the faint stench of unwashed bodies and rotting fish.

**From the inside:** The single-room house is in utter disarray. Broken furniture and smashed fishing equipment litter the floor, while a long table in the center holds a crude map of the village marked with goblin scrawls. Fish bones, dirty dishes, and a foul-smelling goblin stew bubble over a poorly tended fire in one corner. In the shadows, a few goblins lurk, distracted by a crude dice game.

---

### **Encounter Details**

#### **Setup**

The house is occupied by **4-5 goblins**. Two goblins are seated at the table playing a dice game, while the others are rummaging through a chest or sharpening their weapons. A **goblin boss** oversees the group, distracted by the map of the village. If the players are stealthy, they might gain the upper hand.

#### **Skill Opportunities Before Combat**

- **Perception (DC 12)**: Peeking through the windows reveals the number of goblins inside and their positions. A higher roll (DC 15) allows the players to spot the map on the table and other useful items in the room.
- **Stealth (DC 14)**: The group can approach quietly to surprise the goblins, potentially gaining a surprise round.
- **Insight (DC 10)**: Observing the goblins reveals that they are disorganized and distracted, making them vulnerable to a quick, decisive attack.

---

### **Combat Encounter**

**Enemies**:

- **4 Goblins** (basic minions): Distracted and easy to surprise but will fight ferociously once alerted.
- **1 Goblin Boss**: Focused on the map but quick to rally the others. Uses Leadership to give the goblins an edge.

**Tactics**:

- The goblins rely on their small size to duck behind furniture and use ranged attacks.
- The goblin boss tries to use the map table as cover and directs the other goblins to flank the players.
- One goblin might attempt to escape out the back door to alert reinforcements.

**Environmental Features**:

- **Broken Furniture**: Provides half cover for creatures hiding behind it.
- **Fish Stew Fire**: Players can knock over the pot of boiling stew as an improvised attack (Dexterity check, DC 12) to deal 1d6 fire damage to a creature in range.
- **Fishing Nets**: A player can grab a nearby fishing net and use it to restrain a goblin (Improvised Weapon, opposed Strength or Dexterity check, DC 13).

---

### **Loot**

- The **map on the table** is a crude depiction of the village, marked with goblin patrol routes and the locations of key points, such as the Rusty Lantern and the goblin leader’s headquarters.
- **Treasure Chest**: A locked chest (Thieves' Tools, DC 13 to pick or DC 15 Strength to force open) contains:
    - 15 gold pieces.
    - A **Potion of Healing**.
    - A strange, magical fishing lure that glows faintly when submerged in water (detects nearby fish or water creatures).
- **Goblin Dice**: A set of weighted dice that might intrigue players looking for gambling tools.

---

### **Alternate Outcomes**

- **If the Players Avoid Combat**: The goblins are distracted enough that the players might sneak in, grab the map and loot, and leave without being noticed. A failed Stealth roll, however, alerts the goblins and starts combat.
- **If the Goblins Escape**: If a goblin escapes to alert reinforcements, the players will face an ambush further into the village.

---

### **Roleplaying Big Fin's House**

- **Environmental Storytelling**: Include subtle details about Big Fin's former life, such as old fishing trophies, nets, and a faded journal with notes about the village. Players who investigate might learn more about the goblins’ invasion and the history of the town.
- **Journal Clue**: A journal entry reveals that Big Fin had a hidden cache of valuables buried near the riverbank behind the house (players can dig it up later with Investigation or Survival, DC 14).

---

### **Narrative Options**

- **Sneak and Gather Intel**: The players may opt to observe the goblins to gather information without engaging.
- **Rescue Opportunity**: Add a captured villager (e.g., Big Fin or another NPC) tied up in the corner. Players can save them for bonus story points or rewards.
- **Set a Trap**: The players might lure the goblins outside or use the fire to smoke them out, turning the encounter into a tactical puzzle.

This encounter offers flexibility for roleplaying, combat, and exploration while tying into the larger goblin invasion. It’s up to the players whether to engage or bypass the house, making it a fun optional stop along the way!

# Crossing the Path to the Rusty Lantern
### **Crossing the Path to the Rusty Lantern**

The group now approaches the **Rusty Lantern**, navigating the open path to the inn. Goblins control the streets, and the challenge lies in crossing the open area without being noticed or engaging in a prolonged fight. The cornered position of the inn and the big tree provide opportunities for both cover and ambushes.

---

### **Scene Description**

**As the group approaches the Rusty Lantern...**

The wide dirt path stretches ahead, lined with patches of overgrown grass and weeds. To the right, a massive tree looms, its gnarled branches casting long, jagged shadows in the flickering torchlight. The road ahead bends sharply, wrapping around the Rusty Lantern, a once-cozy inn now flickering with torchlight and shadowy movement from within.

Goblin patrols roam the streets in pairs, their guttural voices carrying through the still night air. The sound of shuffling feet and jangling weapons grows louder as two goblins step into view from around the corner, heading toward the tree.

[[Goblin Potential Dialog\|Goblin Potential Dialog]]

The front of the inn stands just beyond the crossroads, its porch creaking under the weight of goblin guards. A faint orange glow from the windows suggests a fire inside, and the faint sound of arguing goblins filters out into the night.

---

### **DM Notes: Crossing the Path**

This encounter can play out as:

1. A **stealth and skill-based challenge** to sneak across the path and reach the inn without alerting goblins.
2. A **combat scenario** where the group engages the goblin patrols in the open.
3. A **mixed approach**, allowing for creative tactics like distraction, ambush, or intimidation.

---

### **Stealth and Skill Challenge**

**Goal**: Reach the Rusty Lantern's front door without being detected by goblin patrols. Players must achieve **4 successes before 3 failures** using a mix of skills.

#### **Skill Options and Obstacles**

1. **Stealth (DC 14)**:
    
    - Sneak from cover to cover, avoiding the sightlines of patrolling goblins.
    - Failure: A goblin notices movement and moves closer to investigate.
2. **Perception (DC 12)**:
    
    - Identify the timing of the goblin patrols and find a clear moment to cross the road.
    - Failure: The group miscalculates, stepping into a goblin patrol's path.
3. **Athletics (DC 13)**:
    
    - Dash across the road quickly when a gap in the patrols opens up.
    - Failure: A player stumbles, creating noise and alerting the goblins.
4. **Deception (DC 15)**:
    
    - Mimic goblin sounds to misdirect the patrol or create confusion.
    - Failure: The goblins grow suspicious and stop to investigate.
5. **Nature (DC 12)** (optional):
    
    - Use the large tree for cover or create a distraction by shaking its branches.
    - Failure: The noise attracts the goblins rather than distracting them.
6. **Survival (DC 13)** (optional):
    
    - Identify a hidden route through the grass or tree line to approach the inn unseen.
    - Failure: The hidden route takes too long, allowing more goblins to converge on the area.

---

### **Complications for Failures**

Each failure introduces a new complication, escalating the tension:

1. **First Failure**: A goblin patrol pauses to investigate, forcing the group to freeze in place for a round.
2. **Second Failure**: A pair of goblins begins moving toward the group’s position, requiring an additional Stealth check to avoid detection (DC +2).
3. **Third Failure**: A goblin blows a crude horn, summoning **2 more goblins** from the inn to join the patrol.

---

### **Combat Encounter: Goblin Patrol**

If the party is detected or decides to fight:

- **Enemies**: 4 goblins and 1 goblin boss.
- **Patrol Tactics**:
    - The goblins use the tree and other cover to fire arrows at the group.
    - The goblin boss tries to hold the group in the open with ranged attacks while calling for reinforcements.
- **Environmental Features**:
    - **Big Tree**: Provides full cover if players climb or position themselves behind it.
    - **Barrels and Crates** (near the inn): Provide half cover for players or goblins.
    - **Choking Smoke**: The faint glow inside the inn might suggest a fire. Players near the inn’s front porch might have to roll Constitution Saving Throws (DC 12) to avoid being distracted by the smoke.

---

### **Creative Player Actions**

Encourage players to come up with creative strategies. Here are examples of how they might use their skills:

- **Distraction**: A player might light a small fire or throw a noisy object toward the big tree to divert goblins (Sleight of Hand or Deception, DC 14).
- **Climbing the Tree**: Players can use the tree’s height to scout ahead or take out goblins from above (Athletics DC 12 to climb, Acrobatics DC 13 to maintain balance).
- **Ambush**: A player might hide in the tree and leap down onto a passing goblin patrol (Athletics DC 13 for the jump, Attack roll with advantage for the strike).

# Entering the Inn
### **Entering the Inn**

Once the group crosses the path and reaches the Rusty Lantern:

- The front door is locked but can be picked (Thieves’ Tools, DC 13) or forced open (Strength check, DC 15). Success here doesn’t alert the goblins inside unless players fail by 5 or more.
- If the goblins are already alerted, **2 goblins and a goblin boss** guard the entryway, using overturned tables for cover.
- Players may hear the sounds of **Group B** fighting deeper inside, adding urgency to their mission.

---

### **Outcome**

- **Success (Stealth)**: The group enters the Rusty Lantern unnoticed, gaining the element of surprise for the battle inside.
- **Success (Combat)**: The group fights through the patrols and reaches the inn but loses the chance for a surprise round.
- **Failure (Stealth)**: The goblins are fully alerted, and reinforcements flood the inn during the final battle.

This setup creates a tense and dynamic encounter, encouraging creativity while emphasizing the goblin threat and the importance of teamwork!
