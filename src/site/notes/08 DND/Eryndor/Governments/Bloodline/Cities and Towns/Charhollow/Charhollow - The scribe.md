# **Owen Kel (Town Scribe)**

Owen was once an aspiring scholar in a grand city far to the south, but he was expelled for "creative differences" with his professors (namely, his tendency to embellish historical records with flair). Returning to the small town of his youth, he took up the role of town scribe, documenting daily events, disputes, and even births and deaths. Owenâ€™s true passion lies in writing grandiose fictional tales, which he bases loosely on the townsfolk's lives. The town's records are peppered with subtle references to these "heroic" exploits, much to the amusement (or irritation) of those who notice.
