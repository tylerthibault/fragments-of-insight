# **Ellie and Timmy**

Ellie and Timmy are siblings, aged 10 and 8, who are infamous around town for their pranks and boundless energy. Orphaned at a young age, they were taken in by Elder Hettie, who does her best to guide them. Ellie, the older sibling, is the brains of their operations, always coming up with elaborate schemes, while Timmy is the enthusiastic accomplice who often gets them caught. Despite their mischievous nature, the siblings have good hearts and often use their pranks to help others, such as stealing food to leave anonymously for a struggling family. They dream of becoming adventurers like Mina Windstep and often follow her around, much to her annoyance (and secret delight).
