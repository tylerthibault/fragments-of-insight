# **Opening Quest: The Siege of Charhollow**

---

**Premise:**  
The adventurers, all young and brave heroes, come from different places and backgrounds but find themselves converging on the peaceful village of Charhollow at the same time. Goblins have taken over the village, capturing its people and turning its heart—the village inn—into their stronghold. Each group has their own reason for being near Charhollow and must find their way into the village, facing challenges before uniting to liberate it.

---

# **Part 1: Converging Paths**

**Group Backgrounds:**

1. **Group A:** This group is traveling to Charhollow as their destination—maybe they’re delivering supplies or visiting family. Along the way, they find an overturned cart and meet a fleeing villager who warns them of the danger.
2. **Group B:** This group is just passing by the outskirts of Charhollow and stumbles upon a frightened child hiding in the bushes. The child begs for help, saying their family is trapped in the village.
3. **Optional Group C (if needed):** These adventurers are camping nearby and see smoke rising from the village. They decide to investigate, curious and eager to help.

---

**Arrival and Discovery:**  
Each group works with their DM to make their way toward Charhollow. Along the way, they notice signs of trouble: broken fences, abandoned belongings, and Goblin patrols.

- **Encounter 1 (For Each Group):**  
    Each group faces a small Goblin scouting party. The Goblins are more mischievous than outright dangerous at this stage, giving the kids a chance to test their skills and teamwork.
    - Examples of creative challenges: Sneaking past the patrol, tricking the Goblins, or setting up an ambush.

**Objective:** Reach the outskirts of Charhollow and decide how to proceed into the village.

---

# **Part 2: Advancing Toward the Inn**

**The Journey to the Center:**  
Each group has its own path into Charhollow, providing different challenges and chances for roleplaying.

1. **Group A’s Path:** They find themselves on the main road leading to Charhollow. This path is heavily guarded by Goblins who have set up makeshift barricades. The group must either fight their way through or find a creative way around.
2. **Group B’s Path:** They sneak through a forested area and stumble upon a Goblin camp where prisoners are being held. They must decide whether to rescue the villagers quietly or launch an attack.
3. **Optional Group C’s Path:** They enter through an old, abandoned orchard and face environmental hazards (like Goblin traps) alongside Goblin guards.

---

**Reunited at the Inn:**  
Eventually, the groups converge at the village inn, which is now the Goblin headquarters. They meet for the first time, share their stories, and decide to team up. This is a great opportunity for roleplaying and bonding as the groups plan their next move.

---

# **Part 3: Taking the Inn**

**The Battle for the Inn:**  
The Goblins have fortified the inn, but the adventurers now have the advantage of numbers and teamwork.

- **Key Challenges:**
    - The Goblins have blocked the main doors and windows. The adventurers will need to find a way to breach the defenses.
    - Inside the inn, the Goblins have set traps (kid-friendly puzzles) and hidden some of the hostages.
    - The Goblin leader, a crafty (and slightly silly) boss character, awaits on the top floor.

**Objective:** Liberate the inn and rescue any villagers held there.

---

# **Part 4: Planning the Liberation**

**At the Inn:**  
After reclaiming the inn, the adventurers use it as their new base of operations. They can take time to heal, talk to the rescued villagers, and gather information about the Goblins’ activities.

**Strategizing:**  
The group decides how to approach the rest of the village. This is where the adventurers split up again into two or three smaller groups, each tasked with clearing a different part of Charhollow.

---

# **Part 5: Freeing the Village**

**Encounters for Each Group:**

1. **Ambush at the Market Square:** Goblins have turned the square into a chaotic mess. The group must deal with both enemies and environmental hazards (like falling crates or overturned stalls).
2. **Hostages at the Blacksmith’s Forge:** A group of Goblins has taken control of the forge, using its heat to scare the villagers. The adventurers must rescue the captives without endangering them.
3. **Securing the Watchtower (Optional):** Another group finds a lookout tower occupied by Goblins who are alerting their allies. The adventurers must deal with this threat before it can call for reinforcements.

---

# **Part 6: The Final Stand**

**The Town Hall Showdown:**  
The two or three groups reunite at the village square and storm the town hall together. The Goblin leader is waiting with their toughest allies for one last, climactic battle.

- **Optional Twist:** During the final fight, the Goblins reveal they were forced into this raid by a mysterious figure (hinting at a larger villain for future adventures).

**Conclusion:**  
The adventurers save Charhollow and are celebrated as heroes. The villagers offer them thanks, gifts, and perhaps clues for their next journey.

# **DM Tips for Running Multi-DM Adventures:**

1. **Stay in Sync:** The DMs should periodically check in with each other to ensure the groups' progress aligns and they meet at the right points.
2. **Kid-Friendly Goblins:** Make the Goblins goofy and fun to fight—more like mischievous troublemakers than truly menacing villains.
3. **Focus on Collaboration:** Encourage teamwork and creativity in solving problems, both within and between the groups.
4. **Celebrate the Players:** Make sure every kid gets a chance to shine, whether through combat, problem-solving, or roleplaying.
