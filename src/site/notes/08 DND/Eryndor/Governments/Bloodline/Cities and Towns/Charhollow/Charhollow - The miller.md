# **Orlan the Miller**

Orlan grew up in the shadow of his family's mill, inheriting it when his parents passed unexpectedly during a harsh winter. Though his hands are calloused and his demeanor gruff, he has a deep sense of responsibility to the town. He ensures that every grain is processed, even for those who cannot afford his services, often bartering for goods or doing it for free. Orlan secretly writes poetry about the cycles of the seasons, which he hides under the millstones. His poems reflect his longing for a simpler, peaceful life beyond the millâ€™s demands.
