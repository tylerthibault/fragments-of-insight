# **Farmer Jedrick**

Jedrick is a hardworking man who has tilled the same fields his family has for generations. While he takes immense pride in his work, he's also deeply protective of his land, which brings him into frequent clashes with Gregor the Hunter. Jedrick claims the hunter’s game damages his crops, but deep down, he secretly admires Gregor’s wilderness skills. His no-nonsense attitude hides a soft heart—he takes in stray animals and cares for them, earning the nickname "Farmer Soft-Hands" among the children. He dreams of one day building a proper barn to house them all.
