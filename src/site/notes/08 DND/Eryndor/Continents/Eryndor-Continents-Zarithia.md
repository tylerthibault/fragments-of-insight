- **Overview**: Zarithia is a large island-continent that combines vast savannas, coastal cliffs, and dense jungles. Isolated from the mainland continents, it has developed a unique culture shaped by its geographic seclusion and the constant interplay between its lush landscapes and harsh weather patterns. Zarithia is known for its ancient ruins, mystical traditions, and the fierce independence of its people. While parts of the island flourish with life, the southern regions bear scars from ancient magical conflicts, creating a stark contrast between verdant beauty and desolation.
- **Cultural Traits**: The people of Zarithia value self-reliance, oral traditions, and a deep connection to the land and its spirits. Their isolation has fostered a strong sense of unity, though rival factions often clash over control of its rich natural resources and mystical relics.
