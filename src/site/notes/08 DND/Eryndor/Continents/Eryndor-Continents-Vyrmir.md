# **Vyrmir: The Frozen Expanse**

## **Overview**

Vyrmir is a frozen, unforgiving land characterized by glaciers, jagged ice cliffs, and vast tundras. Divided between the Frostcall Tribes in the west and the Aurorak Tribes in the east, this continent is a place of resilience and mystery. The people of Vyrmir look to the auroras as divine signs, shaping their culture and spirituality around the lights that dance across the skies. Ancient secrets are said to be buried beneath the glaciers, waiting for those bold enough to uncover them.

# **Geography**

- **Climate**: Perpetual winter, with icy winds, blizzards, and temperatures well below freezing.
- **Major Features**:
    1. **Frostbite Bluff** (Frostcall Territory): A towering plateau in the northwest overlooking the icy expanse below. Its jagged crystalline edges glisten faintly under the auroras. The Frostcall Tribes use the bluff as a sacred site for rituals and gatherings.
    2. **The Shardspine Mountains** (Central Vyrmir): A jagged mountain range that separates the Frostcall and Aurorak Tribes. Its peaks are nearly impassable, covered in perpetual snow, and rumored to contain hidden caves holding relics of ancient magic.
    3. **Shiverpoint** (Aurorak Territory): A spiritual hub located on the eastern coast. This settlement is built along cliffs overlooking the ocean, where the auroras appear brightest. Pilgrims travel here to witness and interpret the lights.
    4. **Everfrost** (Neutral Territory): A large, neutral settlement at the base of the Shardspine Mountains, serving as the primary trading hub for both tribes. Built atop geothermal vents, it remains surprisingly warm and hospitable.
    5. **Northguard** (Frostcall Territory): A fortified settlement in the southwest, serving as a defense against raiders and a gathering point for hunters and herders.
