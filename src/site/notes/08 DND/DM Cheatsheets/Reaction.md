### **Reactions in D&D**

A **Reaction** is a special type of action that you can take **outside of your turn** in response to a specific event. Unlike Actions and Bonus Actions, which occur on your turn, a Reaction happens **immediately** when triggered by certain conditions.

#### **Key Points About Reactions**

1. **One Reaction Per Round**:
    
    - You can only take one Reaction per round (not per turn).
    - Your Reaction refreshes at the start of your next turn.
2. **Triggered by Specific Events**:
    
    - A Reaction is only triggered by a specific event, such as an enemy moving out of your reach or a spell requiring a saving throw.
3. **Interrupts the Flow**:
    
    - Reactions happen instantly and can sometimes interrupt the flow of combat (e.g., Counterspell cancels a spell being cast).
4. **You Can’t React While Surprised**:
    
    - If you’re surprised at the start of combat, you cannot take Reactions until your first turn ends.

### **Common Uses of Reactions**

Here are some common ways players and creatures use Reactions:

#### **Opportunity Attacks**

- **Trigger**: When an enemy moves out of your melee reach without taking the Disengage action.
- **Effect**: You make a melee attack against the enemy.
- **Key Notes**:
    - Requires a melee weapon.
    - Does not work against teleportation or forced movement (e.g., being pushed by Thunderwave).
    - Some creatures or characters have abilities that prevent Opportunity Attacks (e.g., Mobile feat).

#### **Class Features**

- **Fighter**: **Parry** (Battle Master Maneuver)
    - Use a Reaction to reduce damage from an incoming attack.
- **Paladin**: **Divine Smite** (via the feature "Smite Evil" in some editions)
    - React to specific situations (e.g., smiting undead or fiends on a critical hit).
- **Monk**: **Deflect Missiles**
    - Use your Reaction to reduce damage from a ranged weapon attack and potentially catch the projectile.
- **Barbarian**: **Instinctive Pounce** (Optional Feature)
    - Use a Reaction to move up to half your speed when an enemy moves within range.

#### **Spells**

- Some spells can be cast as Reactions. Examples include:
    - **Shield**: +5 to AC until the start of your next turn.
    - **Counterspell**: Interrupt and cancel a spell being cast by another creature.
    - **Hellish Rebuke**: React to being damaged by a creature, causing it to take fire damage.
    - **Absorb Elements**: Reduce elemental damage and store it for your next attack.

#### **Feats**

- **Sentinel**:
    - When a creature within your reach attacks someone else, you can use your Reaction to make a melee attack.
    - Stops creatures from moving if you hit them with an Opportunity Attack.
- **Mage Slayer**:
    - Use your Reaction to attack a creature casting a spell within 5 feet of you.

#### **Racial Traits**

- **Tiefling**: **Hellish Rebuke**
    - Automatically gain the Hellish Rebuke spell, allowing a Reaction to retaliate against damage.
- **Dragonborn (Gem)**: **Psionic Mind Shield**
    - Use a Reaction to protect yourself from psychic damage.

### **Special Situations for Reactions**

1. **Counterspell Battles**:
    - Multiple creatures casting Counterspell in response to each other creates a chain of Reactions. Resolve them in the order they occur.
2. **Opportunity Attacks with Reach**:
    - Creatures with a longer reach (e.g., 10 feet instead of 5 feet) can trigger Opportunity Attacks earlier than normal.
3. **Spell Interactions**:
    - Some Reactions (like Shield or Absorb Elements) can completely negate or reduce damage from powerful attacks or spells.

### **DM Tips for Reactions**

1. **Encourage Player Creativity**:
    - Allow players to describe how their character reacts, even for simple Reactions like Opportunity Attacks. This enhances roleplay.
2. **Use Monsters with Reactions**:
    - Give enemies Reactions like Parry or Tail Swipe to make combat more dynamic and challenging.
3. **Track Reactions**:
    - If a creature has already used its Reaction, remind players they can move safely past it without triggering Opportunity Attacks.

### **Reaction Strategy**

- **Tactical Players**:
    - Save your Reaction for the most impactful moment (e.g., Counterspell instead of Opportunity Attack).
- **Melee Fighters**:
    - Position yourself to maximize Opportunity Attack chances, especially if you have feats like Sentinel.
- **Spellcasters**:
    - Keep spell slots available for Reactions like Shield or Counterspell.
