## **D&D DMing Cheat Sheet: Skill Checks**

### **1. What Is a Skill Check?**

A **Skill Check** is a d20 roll modified by the character’s relevant ability modifier and proficiency bonus (if applicable). It determines the success of an action outside combat, like persuading an NPC or spotting a hidden enemy.

### **2. The Process**

1. **The Player States Their Action**:
    
    - The player describes what their character is attempting to do.
    - Example: "I want to climb this slippery wall."
2. **The DM Determines the Skill**:
    
    - The DM decides which skill is relevant (e.g., Athletics for climbing) and the associated ability (e.g., Strength for Athletics).
3. **The DM Sets the Difficulty Class (DC)**:
    
    - The DM chooses a DC based on the task's difficulty:
        - DC 5: Very Easy
        - DC 10: Easy
        - DC 15: Moderate
        - DC 20: Hard
        - DC 25: Very Hard
        - DC 30: Nearly Impossible
4. **The Player Rolls the d20**:
    
    - Add the relevant ability modifier and proficiency bonus (if proficient in the skill).
    - Compare the total to the DC.
5. **Success or Failure**:
    
    - If the total equals or exceeds the DC, the action succeeds.
    - If the total is lower than the DC, the action fails (but failure may still provide partial results depending on the situation).

### **4. Advanced Mechanics**

#### **Passive Skills**

- Passive skills represent a character’s “always-on” abilities.
- **Formula**: Passive Score = 10 + skill modifier.
- Example: Passive Perception is used to detect hidden creatures or objects without rolling.

#### **Opposed Rolls**

- Some skill checks are contested by another creature's roll:
    - **Stealth vs. Perception**: Hiding from an enemy.
    - **Deception vs. Insight**: Lying to someone.
    - **Athletics vs. Athletics/Acrobatics**: Grappling or escaping a grapple.

#### **Group Skill Checks**

- When the whole group is attempting the same task (e.g., sneaking), the DM can call for a group skill check:
    - At least **half the group** must succeed for the whole group to succeed.

#### **Tool Proficiency**

- If a character is proficient with a tool (e.g., Thieves' Tools, Herbalism Kit), the DM may allow a tool check instead of a skill check.
    - Example: Picking a lock could use Dexterity + Thieves' Tools instead of Sleight of Hand.

### **6. Tips for Skill Checks**

1. **Describe the Scene**:
    - Encourage players to roleplay their skill checks. For example, don’t just say, “I roll Persuasion.” Instead, let the player describe how they are persuading the NPC.
2. **Reward Creativity**:
    - If a player comes up with a clever idea, lower the DC or give them advantage.
3. **Failure Doesn’t Mean the End**:
    - Failure can still drive the story forward. For example, a failed Intimidation check might anger an NPC, leading to a fight or new complications.
