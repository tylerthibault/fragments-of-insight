### **Bonus Actions in D&D**

A **Bonus Action** is an additional action that a character can take on their turn, but only if a specific rule, feature, spell, or ability explicitly allows it. Not every character can take a Bonus Action every turn.

#### **Key Points About Bonus Actions**

1. **Only One Bonus Action Per Turn**:
    
    - You can use only one Bonus Action during your turn, even if multiple abilities grant Bonus Actions.
2. **When You Can Use It**:
    
    - You can take a Bonus Action on your turn if you meet the conditions for it. For example, if you're a Rogue, your class feature (Cunning Action) allows you to Dash, Disengage, or Hide as a Bonus Action.
3. **Separate from Regular Actions**:
    
    - Bonus Actions are in addition to your normal Action and Movement, but they do not replace them.

#### **Off-Hand Attacks (Two-Weapon Fighting)**

- If you attack with a light melee weapon in one hand, you can use your Bonus Action to make an off-hand attack with a different light melee weapon in your other hand.

2. **Know Your Character**:
    - Make a list of your character’s Bonus Actions to avoid confusion.
3. **Timing Matters**:
    - Some Bonus Actions (like Healing Word) can turn the tide of battle if used at the right moment.

### **Bonus Actions Strategy Tips**

- **Monks**: Use your Bonus Action to increase your mobility (Step of the Wind) or deal extra damage (Flurry of Blows).
- **Rogues**: Use Cunning Action to move in and out of combat safely without taking opportunity attacks.
- **Spellcasters**: Combine a Bonus Action spell (like Misty Step) with a regular Action to maximize your turn.
